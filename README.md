# Studio-Ghibli-API
Utilizing HTML and JavaScript to connect to an API and display the information from that API in a simple web page.


Used the JavaScript XMLHttpRequest object to connect to the Studio Ghibli API and retrieve a list of the titles of all Studio Ghibli films.(Did not use jQuery or other third-party libraries)

Created a simple HTML page, and utilized JavaScript to dynamically populate an HTML <select> element with the list of film titles retrieved.

When the user selects a film from the drop-down menu created, the description of that film is displayed by dynamically populating appropriate HTML element.
